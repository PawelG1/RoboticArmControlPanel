# RoboticArmControlPanel
 A .NET Windows Forms application serving as a control panel for easy operation of a robotic arm. Features include servo management, sensor monitoring, and automated workflow.

## About
This project was created as part of coursework for .NET programming classes. It demonstrates the use of Windows Forms to build a control interface for a robotic arm.


## Features
- Control servos of a robotic arm.
- Monitor sensor statuses.
- Automate robotic arm movements with predefined sequences.
- Send simple commands to ESP uC.

## Usage
1. Connect the robotic arm to your computer via USB.
2. Select the appropriate COM port in the application.
3. Use the control panel to move the robotic arm, monitor sensors, or execute automated movements.

## Requirements
- Robotic Arm created by me :P 
    *(Source files of the ESP microcontroller code will be added in the future.)*
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
